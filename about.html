I come from India, live in Germany, but I call many places home since traveling is one of my hobbies. I love what I do, and adore the creative process; it is addictive and can give never ending possibilities</p> <p>Holding a degree in Bachelors of Arts, Diploma in Air-hostess training and a Diploma in teachers training, now I'm highly motivated to start something totally new that is in Trend. I have never failed in my performances say it in School, collage, University or in my Position of employment. Over a course I had to quit my Job as my priorities changed after becoming a mom, However, time flies and here I'm again to accept a new challenge in Web Development.</p> <p>I can provide clean code and pixel perfect design, make the website more & more interactive with web animations. A responsive design makes your website accessible to all users, regardless of their device. </p> <p>Considering my academic performances so far and my desire to enrich mine and other's knowledge in Web Development.
